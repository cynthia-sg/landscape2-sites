      If you've researched cloud native applications and technologies, you've probably come
      across the [CNCF cloud native landscape](https://cncf.landscape2.io). Unsurprisingly,
      the sheer scale of it can be overwhelming. So many categories and so many technologies.

      In this guide, we'll break this mammoth landscape down and provide a high-level overview
      of its layers, columns, and categories.
